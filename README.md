# Multi play

## A Skeleton Multiplayer project

This project was first put together for the October 2013 uSwitch London Clojure Dojo.

To get started:

``` bash
lein run
```

## Build your own game

The bulk of the game play has been left blank so that you can build your own game.  The essential files that you need to "fill in the blanks" include:

``` clojure
  (ns multiplay.game.core)  ;; clj
  (ns multiplay.views.arena) ;; cljs
```
